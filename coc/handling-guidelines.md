# Incident handling guidelines

This has been made public so we can be held accountable for our actions. We invite you to report any member of our team you believe may not be following it directly to the event organisers (see the [Staff](/staff) page for details on how to contact us if you are unable to find us in person)

# If there is any immediate threat to the safety of anyone contact police.

# Gather information
Get a written statement or transcribe what has been said. This information should include details of:
- Which persons are involved
- What behaviour lead to the complaint
- The time and location of said behaviour
- Any additional circumstances surrounding the incident

# In case of distress
- Find them a quite place to be
- Ask if they need/want a friend to be with them
- Ask "How can I help you?"
- Give them contact information for the conference organisers

# What do to next
A meeting of all conference organisers should be called immediately or if not possible
at the quickly as possible, this meeting should;
- Determine what happened
- Consider possible routes of action

Then the subject of the complaint shall be invited into the meeting (in private) to 
respond. After the response has been heard the meeting will decide on the appropriate
course of action, and communicate it appropriately.

# Emergency action
If an emergency situation presents itself then it may be required that we take immediate
action by interrupting or halting a session that is a serious violation of the Code of Conduct,
or give a verbal warning on the spot.

# Do not
- Invite/suggest a complainant to withdraw their complaint
- Ask for their advice on how to deal with the issue
- Ask for their opinion on an appropriate sanction


# Keep a written record
It is important to stay accountable and in the result that any follow up is required after the event 
a written record of all actions and reports must be kept.
